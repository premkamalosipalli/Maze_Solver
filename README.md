# Maze Solver

Depth first Search is used to find the destination from the given source in the Maze. Recursive or iterative algorithms can be used for this. 
The main goal of producing this article was to determine which method is best for creating a maze. 
It is accomplished by evaluating how quickly each algorithm generates a maze.

## Description

A maze is a picture that comprises of blocks that might be white or black in color, with the black blocks standing in for the walls and the white
blocks for the road leading from one end to the other. The boundaries of the maze serve to depict the path, while the nodes serve to symbolize the
white blocks. By connecting the edges from one node to another until you reach the end node, the graph's route may be determined.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* In order run this programs you need to install Visual Studio Code and add Extension for running cpp file.
* This will work on Windows and MacOS operating systems and they must contain VS Code.

### Installing

* You can download VS Code from the offical website based on the platform you are working.
  ```
  https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  ```
* Add all the extensions that are requried for compiling and Running the cpp files.

### Executing program

* Fallow the Steps to run the above programs:
* Step-1
```
Download the project and then unzip the two folders.
```
* step-2
```
Open the two folders in your vscode workspace and then try to navigate to the folder path from terminal.
```
* Step-3
```
type the below command in the termainl once you are in the folder path.
* Command to Compile Recursive Maze program
g++ -o <output_file_name> recursiveMaze.cpp
(In the place of <output_file_name> give the file name you want to create ex:recursiveMazeOutput ).
* Command to Run Recursive Maze program
./recursiveMazeOutput 
```
```
type the below command in the termainl once you are in the folder path.
* Command to Compile Iterative Maze program
g++ -o <output_file_name>  iterativeMaze.cpp 
(In the place of <output_file_name> give the file name you want to create ex:iterativeMazeOutput ).
* Command to Run Recursive Maze program
./iterativeMazeOutput 
```
